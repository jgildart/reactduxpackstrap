#ReactDuxPackStrap

ReactDuxPackStrap is a React + Redux + Webpack + Bootstrap example project made to help Dr. Ussell make a foosball application...

## Getting Started

Install all the dependencies

`npm install`

Make sure you have Webpack installed

`npm install -g webpack`

Build the bundle

`webpack`

Watch for changes an rebuild the bundle

`webpack --watch`

Once you have the dependencies downloaded and the bundle built, open `index.html` in the browser and play with the super basic counter application.
